# Install-TechAgentRuntime

Verifies Ollama availability and optionally pulls the configured agent model.

---

## Overview

`Install-TechAgentRuntime` validates that the Ollama runtime is installed and available on the local system. It reports any locally available models and, when requested, pulls a specific AI model for use with `Invoke-TechAgent`.

> **Note:** This function no longer manages repository-local Python environments or virtual environments. It focuses exclusively on Ollama validation and model management.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **PythonPath** | `string` | Deprecated compatibility parameter. Ignored by this function. |
| **ForceRecreateVenv** | `switch` | Deprecated compatibility parameter. Ignored by this function. |
| **UpgradePip** | `switch` | Deprecated compatibility parameter. Ignored by this function. |
| **UpgradePackages** | `switch` | Deprecated compatibility parameter. Ignored by this function. |
| **PullModel** | `switch` | When present, pulls the selected Ollama model after validating the local Ollama runtime. |
| **Model** | `string` | The name of the Ollama model to pull when `-PullModel` is used. Defaults to the value in `settings.agent.model`. |

## How It Works

### **Ollama Validation**
The function first checks if Ollama is installed and accessible on the system.
- If Ollama is not found, an error is raised indicating that Ollama must be installed.
- If Ollama is available, it reports any models currently present locally.

### **Model Pulling**
When `-PullModel` is specified:
1. The function determines the target model name (using the `-Model` parameter or `settings.agent.model`).
2. It initiates a pull of that model from the Ollama library.
3. Upon completion, it confirms the successful installation of the model.

---

## Examples

### **Basic validation**
Verifies Ollama is installed and lists local models without pulling anything.
```powershell
Install-TechAgentRuntime
```

### **Pull a specific model**
Pulls the `qwen3.6:35b` model for use with the agent.
```powershell
Install-TechAgentRuntime -PullModel -Model "qwen3.6:35b"
```

## Notes

- Requires **Ollama** to be installed and running on the local machine.
- Deprecated parameters (`PythonPath`, `ForceRecreateVenv`, `UpgradePip`, `UpgradePackages`) are retained for backward compatibility but have no effect.
- Model defaults are driven by configuration in `settings.agent.model` if `-Model` is not explicitly provided.
