# Get-MessageTrace

## SYNOPSIS
Retrieves Exchange Online message trace summaries and per-recipient details using the V2 cmdlets, with automatic date-range chunking and throttle-aware retries.

## SYNTAX
```powershell
Get-MessageTrace [-MessageId <String>] [-Sender <String>] [-Recipient <String>] [-Subject <String>] [-SubjectFilterType <String>] -StartDate <DateTime> -EndDate <DateTime> [-ExportFolder <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Executes a full message trace workflow against Exchange Online:

1. **VALIDATION** Confirms that at least one filter (MessageId, Sender, Recipient, or Subject) is supplied and that StartDate < EndDate.
2. **CONNECTION** Auto-connects to Exchange Online if the V2 cmdlets are not already visible in the session. Uses Connect-ExchangeOnlineAlways (internal wrapper) when available, otherwise falls back to the native Connect-ExchangeOnline.
3. **CHUNKED SUMMARY QUERY (Get-MessageTraceV2)** EXO limits each Get-MessageTraceV2 request to a 10-day window and returns at most 5,000 rows per call. This function automatically splits the requested date range into ≤10-day slices and uses the continuation-token pattern (StartingRecipientAddress + adjusted EndDate) to page through result sets larger than 5,000 rows.
4. **THROTTLE HANDLING** All EXO calls are wrapped in an exponential-backoff retry loop (up to 5 attempts, doubling from 1 s to a 30 s cap) that retries on HTTP 429 / 503 / "Too many requests" / "temporarily unavailable" errors. A 200 ms inter-request pause is applied between continuation pages to stay within the tenant rate limit (~100 requests / 5 min).
5. **DETAIL QUERY (Get-MessageTraceDetailV2)** For every row in the summary, individual delivery-event details are fetched by MessageTraceId + RecipientAddress. Non-fatal per-recipient failures are logged as warnings and do not abort the run.
6. **EXPORT** When settings.messageTrace.autoExport is true, or when -ExportFolder is supplied, both the summary view and the detail rows are passed to Export-MessageTraceResults.

## PARAMETERS

### -MessageId <String>
The Message ID of the message to trace.

### -Sender <String>
The sender's email address.

### -Recipient <String>
The recipient's email address.

### -Subject <String>
The subject line of the message (or part of it).

### -SubjectFilterType <String>
Specifies how the Subject filter is applied. Options typically include 'Contains', 'Equals', etc., depending on EXO V2 cmdlet support.

### -StartDate <DateTime>
The start date of the trace range. Must be earlier than EndDate.

### -EndDate <DateTime>
The end date of the trace range. Must be later than StartDate.

### -ExportFolder <String>
Optional folder path to export the results to CSV files.

## INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to Get-MessageTrace.

## OUTPUTS
[PSCustomObject] Returns a collection of message trace summary objects and detail objects.

## EXAMPLES
### Example 1: Trace by Sender
```powershell
Get-MessageTrace -Sender 'user@contoso.com' -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7) -EndDate (Get-Date)
```
This command retrieves all messages sent by user@contoso.com in the last 7 days.

### Example 2: Trace by Recipient with Export
```powershell
Get-MessageTrace -Recipient 'admin@contoso.com' -StartDate '01/01/2024' -EndDate '01/31/2024' -ExportFolder 'C:\Traces'
```
This command retrieves all messages received by admin@contoso.com in January 2024 and exports the results to C:\Traces.

## NOTES
- Requires Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module.
- Automatically handles throttling and date-range chunking for large queries.
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions in Exchange Online to run message traces.
