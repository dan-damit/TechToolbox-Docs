# Get-LocalAdminMembers

## SYNOPSIS
Gets local Administrators members with SID + metadata, optionally expanding nested groups.

## SYNTAX

### Default (ComputerName)
```powershell
Get-LocalAdminMembers [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-Group <String>] [-Recurse] [-MaxDepth <Int32>] [-IncludeGroups [<Boolean>]] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Get-LocalAdminMembers` function retrieves the members of a local group (default: Administrators) on one or more specified computers. It returns detailed information including Security Identifiers (SIDs) and metadata for each member.

By default, it lists direct members only. If the `-Recurse` switch is used, it attempts to expand nested groups from both domain and local contexts best-effort up to a specified depth.

## PARAMETERS

### -ComputerName
Specifies one or more computers to query. Accepts pipeline input by property name.
- **Type:** String[]
- **Default Value:** $env:COMPUTERNAME (the local machine)
- **Required?** False
- **Pipeline Input:** True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)

### -Group
Specifies the name of the local group to query for members.
- **Type:** String
- **Default Value:** 'Administrators'
- **Required?** False

### -Recurse
Expands nested groups. When specified, the function will attempt to resolve members within nested domain and local groups.
- **Type:** SwitchParameter
- **Required?** False

### -MaxDepth
Specifies the maximum depth for recursion when expanding nested groups.
- **Type:** Int32
- **Default Value:** 5
- **Validation Range:** 0 to 50
- **Required?** False

### -IncludeGroups
Determines whether group objects themselves are included in the output. If $true, groups appear as members; if $false, only leaf accounts (users/computers) are returned.
- **Type:** Boolean
- **Default Value:** $true
- **Required?** False

### -Credential
Specifies an alternative credential to use for remote operations. This is useful when running the command against remote computers with different permissions.
- **Type:** PSCredential
- **Required?** False

## INPUTS
String[]
You can pipe a string array of computer names to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS
PSCustomObject
Returns objects containing member details such as Name, SID, Type (User/Group/Computer), and Source Computer.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get local admins on the current machine
```powershell
Get-LocalAdminMembers
```
Description: Retrieves the members of the local Administrators group on the computer running the command.

### Example 2: Get local admins on multiple remote computers
```powershell
Get-LocalAdminMembers -ComputerName 'Server01', 'Server02'
```
Description: Retrieves the members of the local Administrators group on Server01 and Server02.

### Example 3: Expand nested groups
```powershell
Get-LocalAdminMembers -Recurse -MaxDepth 3
```
Description: Retrieves the members of the local Administrators group and expands any nested groups up to a depth of 3 levels.

## NOTES
This function is designed for administrative auditing and troubleshooting of local group memberships across Windows environments.
